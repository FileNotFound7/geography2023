            Although there was so many effects stated in the <a href="effects.html">effects</a> page, there are also some strategies which we can use to protect rainforests from damage.

            <h2>Carbon Tax</h2>
            One step that we should take is to employ a carbon taxing or trading system in Australia, whereby we can punish large companies and factories for damaging the environment so that they can improve their sustainability practices.
            <br>
            While you may think that businesses can just pass the tax onto their customers and get away with pollution, this is incorrect, because they would have to raise their prices to pass the tax onto customers, and this only makes sustainable businesses more attractive, for lower prices and lower emmissions.
            <br>
            <h2>Expansion Strategies</h2>
            By taking advantage of the vast areas of relatively empty land that Australia has, we can redirect growth from urban areas into different areas where the harm on environment can be more easily minimised. This will protect our rainforests from deforestation.
