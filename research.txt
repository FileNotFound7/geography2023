GEOGRAPHY ASSIGNMENT - CHANGES IN RAINFORESTS
-----------------------------
About:
    1- canopy cover over 70%
    1- canopy provides shade to the forest floor
    1- shade keeps microclimate moist
    1- contain significant biodiversity
    1- "filters" the air
    1- supports water cycles
    1- prevent flooding, soil loss and siltation
    1- cover 0.3% of aus but contain 50% of aussie flora and 30% of aussie mammals and birds
-----------------------------
Causes:
    #- overexploitation of natural resources (for medicine, etc.)
    #- deforestation
    #- land clearing
    #- pollution

-----------------------------
Effects:
    Short Term:
        1- clmchng affects humidity
        1- increased temps from climate change (clmchng)
        1- more hot days/periods of time due to clmchng
        1- more frequent/intense storms from clmchng

    Long Term:
        1- more invasive species and pathogens
        #- depletion of natural resources
        #- increased climate change
        #- biodiversity loss

-----------------------------
Management of changes:
    #- carbon pricing/tax
    #- change expansion strategies to combat deforestation
